# 📊 Project Portfolio: Enterprise Project Management Performance Analysis
## 📌 Project Title

Multi-Project Task Performance, Progress, and Budget Analysis

## 📖 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing and visualizing task-level performance across multiple enterprise projects over a defined project timeline. The dataset contains detailed information on project tasks, managers, schedules, progress levels, and financial performance.

The goal of this analysis is to monitor execution efficiency, track budget utilization, identify delays and bottlenecks, and support data-driven project management decisions through clear, interactive visualizations.

## 🎯 Aim of the Project

To analyze and visualize project execution performance across multiple projects in order to evaluate task progress, time management, managerial efficiency, and budget utilization.

## 🎯 Project Objectives

To evaluate task completion status across projects

To track progress vs. duration for each task

To compare budgeted costs against actual expenditure

To assess manager performance across assigned tasks

To identify delayed, completed, and at-risk tasks

To provide actionable insights for project planning and control

## 🗂 Dataset Description

The dataset contains structured project management data with the following key attributes:

Project Name (Alpha, Delta, Gemini, Orion, Vega)

Task Name

Assigned Manager

Start Date & End Date

Task Duration

Days Completed

Progress Percentage

Budgeted Cost

Actual Cost

Time period covered: 17 February 2020 – 13 March 2020

## 🧹 Data Preparation & Cleaning

The following data preparation steps were performed:

Removed blank and duplicate records

Standardized date formats

Verified task duration consistency

Converted progress values to percentages

Validated budget vs actual cost values

Ensured correct aggregation across projects and managers

## 🛠 Tools & Techniques Used
### 🔧 Tools

Microsoft Excel

Pivot Tables & Pivot Charts

Slicers (Filters)

Conditional Formatting

Dashboard Design Techniques

### 🧠 Techniques

Data cleaning & validation

Aggregation and grouping

Budget vs actual variance analysis

Progress tracking

Task status classification (Not Started, In Progress, Completed)

Interactive dashboard filtering

### ✅ This follows the Data Analysis Process (DAP):
Ask → Prepare → Process → Analyze → Visualize → Share

## 📊 Key Visualizations

The dashboard includes:

Total Budget vs Actual Cost Bar Chart

Task Completion Status Doughnut Chart

Progress vs Days Completed Metrics

Project-wise Task Distribution

Manager Performance Overview

Timeline-based Task Tracking

Interactive Slicers for Projects and Managers

## 📈 Key Insights

Only 3 tasks have been fully completed out of 40 total tasks

33 tasks are currently in progress, indicating execution risk

42% of total planned work has been completed

58% of work remains, requiring closer monitoring

Total budget: $19.7M, Actual spend: $8.34M

Some projects show high budget consumption with low progress

Manager workload distribution is uneven across projects

## 🚧 Challenges Identified

Delays in task execution across multiple projects

Budget under-utilization in early-stage tasks

Risk of deadline overruns due to low completion rates

Need for better workload balancing among managers

## 💡 Recommendations

Prioritize tasks with low progress and high duration

Reallocate managerial resources where workloads are uneven

Monitor high-budget tasks closely to avoid cost overruns

Implement weekly progress reviews using dashboard insights

## 📌 Conclusion

This project demonstrates how data visualization enhances project management decision-making. By combining task schedules, progress metrics, and financial data into a single interactive dashboard, stakeholders can quickly identify risks, monitor performance, and take corrective actions early.

## 📁 Portfolio Value

This project highlights skills in:

Project management analytics
